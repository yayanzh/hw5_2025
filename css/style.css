/* Step 1
Animate the logo with keyframes. It should start at a width of 25px and grow to 475px.  It should also start with an opacity of 0 and end with an opacity of 1. The animation should take 5 seconds and only happen when the page is loaded. */

}

/* Step #2 
Edit the body element to use the Poppins font (using Google fonts) with serif as a backup.  It should also use the image “concrete_seamless.png” as a background-image with a backup color of #f1f1f1. */

Edit the css for the header tag (all instances) to use flex to match our example. */

header{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;

/* Step #4
Edit the css for the nav_links class to use flex to match our example. Do not modify the list items or the links - modify the nav_links class to use flex.  */

/* Step #5
Style the links so that they have the same color even after they have been visited. */

/* Step #6 
Identify the proper selector to style ONLY those header elements that are direct children of a card class.  The required styling is the following: 
background: #288088,
solid 2px border using #45ADAD,
20px of padding on the top and the bottom, 
50px border-radius on the top left and right corners.  */

    border-top-right-radius: 50px;

/* Step #7
Edit the css for the card class to match our example. Achieve this by using a flex-property to specify an initial “size” of 450px.  You need to think about this from a “flex” perspective and realize that flex-direction will affect the size of the elements.  You can see that in the mobile view they all have the same width.  */

Edit the css for the pricing class to match our example. You should use flex and the cards should be centered both horizontally and vertically. */

Edit the css for the gallery class to use flex to match our example. (You may want to look at the screen shots from 1200px and 1500px as well -  the changes are not from media queries, but from the use of flex.) */

    Change the font on your body to Arial with a backup value of  Helvetica */
